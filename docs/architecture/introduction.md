# Introduction

This document captures the **CURRENT STATE** and **PLANNED ARCHITECTURE** of the AI-Powered News CMS project for equity market research. As this is a greenfield project (starting from scratch), this document serves as both a reference for the initial planning state and a blueprint for implementation.

- Current project state (planning phase, infrastructure setup)
- Planned technical architecture based on PRD requirements
- Implementation roadmap organized by Epic
- Integration points with existing equity market research platform
- Technical constraints and decisions already made in the PRD

## Document Status
