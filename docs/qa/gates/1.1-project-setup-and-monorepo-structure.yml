reviewer_notes: |
  This is a well-executed setup story that establishes a solid foundation for the project.

  Key Strengths:
  - All 7 acceptance criteria fully met with evidence
  - Clean, well-documented code
  - Proper architectural patterns established
  - No technical debt introduced
  - Dependencies properly configured

  The example Pydantic model demonstrates the shared schema pattern effectively and
  provides clear guidance for future data model implementation.

  No concerns or blockers identified. Story is ready to be marked as "Done".
