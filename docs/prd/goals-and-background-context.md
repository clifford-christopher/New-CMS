# Goals and Background Context

### Goals

- Enable content managers to configure AI news generation workflows without developer dependency
- Reduce configuration time from days to hours (>90% reduction)
- Support rapid experimentation with prompts, data sources, and AI models
- Support multiple prompt types (paid, unpaid, crawler) for different content distribution channels
- Provide complete visibility into data APIs, structured data, and generation pipeline
- Create scalable foundation for managing 20+ news trigger categories with multi-type prompt variations
- Improve news quality through iterative testing and optimization across different content types
- Eliminate 80% of developer time spent on content configuration tasks
- Enable publishing of production-ready configurations with confidence through comprehensive testing

### Background Context

Our equity market research platform generates AI-powered news articles based on various triggers (earnings results, analyst grade changes, price movements, etc.), but the current system is rigid and hardcoded. Data APIs, prompts, and LLM models are embedded in scripts, requiring developer intervention for any changes. This creates significant friction: content teams cannot experiment with different approaches, iteration cycles are slow (days instead of hours), and there's no visibility into the actual data driving news generation. Additionally, the platform needs to support different content distribution channels (paid subscribers, unpaid users, web crawler/SEO content) with tailored prompts for each audience, but the current system cannot accommodate multiple prompt variations per trigger.

The News CMS will transform this process by providing a visual, interactive interface where content managers can select triggers, configure data sources, craft multiple prompt types (paid, unpaid, crawler) with real-time data preview, test multiple AI models side-by-side, iterate rapidly, and publish production configurations—all without writing code. This empowers content teams to optimize news generation strategies for different audiences, dramatically accelerates iteration cycles, and creates a scalable foundation for future growth.
